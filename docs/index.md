# Hi, I'm Mitchell!

Nice to meet you. I'm a master's student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, studying Data Science and Business Analytics!

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/headshot cropped.jpg" alt="Logo"></p>

My interests include weightlifting, exploring new music, and nerding out over sci-fi and fantasy books. I'm interested in Data-Science and analytics-related roles for January of 2022. Feel free to explore my portfolio - if you'd like to connect, feel free to connect with me on my socials below.
